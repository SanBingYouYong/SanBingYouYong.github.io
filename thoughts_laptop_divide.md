# Decoupling Personal Compute

Spending days at the library during the revision weeks have taught me all and one thing, Windows 11 is far from usable when your RTX gaming laptop depends on its own battery or a smaller GaN power supply. The most irritating thing is the lagging in File Explorer when not connected to external power supply and the laptop decides to slower its compute.

With faith in modern OS backend stability and performance, as well as what front-end people can achieve in the browser, one seeks the opportunity to decouple the Windows 11 frontend from the highly capable hardware. The following is just a simple illustration, basically what humanity has right now in frontend/backend split for client-server interaction inside one metalic case.

~~This is still, quite different to what we have as "modular" laptops. Decoupling hardware and decoupling the service levels are not the same.~~
