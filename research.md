# Research
Interested in combination of CV / CG / NLP. 
- UoE Bachelor Dissertation: *Inverse Procedural Modeling: from Sketches to Buildings*
    - Construct a procedural model for buildings based on Directed Acyclic Graphs (DAG)
    - Distort 3D models and render as a 2D sketch image; generate training data with parameter sampling
    - Encoder-decoder & Multi-task decoders that predict DAG parameters based on input sketch image
    - Develop Blender add-on as user interface
- GraphviX Lab, IPAB, UoE - Summer Research Internship (Summer 2023)
    - Researched on topics of sketch-based inverse procedural modeling. Implemented shape grammars based on Blender geometry nodes and its APIs. Trained neural networks to inference shape parameters from sketches, and integrated above pipelines as a Blender plug-in. Some tech stacks are also part of my bachelor dissertation.
