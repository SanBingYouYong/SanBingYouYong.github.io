# Work Experience
### R&D Internship
- HGTech, summer 2024
    - Worked on digital human topics, deployed various services on compute server directly or using docker containers, hosted locally a Streamlit-driven webpage to track service status
### Algorithms Internship
- VisionTalk, June 2024
    - Improved LLM performance and robustness on chat generation and decision making via breaking down a complex task and designing/implementing a Multi-agent system
### Summer Research Internship
- GraphviX Lab, IPAB, UoE, summer 2023
    - Researched on topics of sketch-based inverse procedural modeling. Implemented shape grammars based on Blender geometry nodes and its APIs. Trained neural networks to inference shape parameters from sketches, and integrated above pipelines as a Blender plug-in. Some tech stacks are also part of my bachelor dissertation. 
### Tutor
- UoE, 2023
    - A paid position delivering weekly tutorials for the course *Reasoning and Agents*, two hours per week
### Software Infrastructure
- Edinburgh University Formula Students (EUFS), 2022 ~ 2023/24
    - Software Infrastructure team for Driverless Vehicle
    - Maintained, refactored and extended `eufs_cli`, the command-line-interface tool in Python
        - refactored 70 lines of repeated code for each command to 5 lines
    - Provide supporting functionalities around git, colcon and more
    - Contributed to the server backend of EUFS-Testing-Application
    - Update launch configurations of the self-driving race car under different tasks
### Algorithms Internship
- Wuhan Tianyu Information Industry, summer 2021
    - Carried out object detection tasks using OpenCV-Python and YOLOv5, trained models focusing on human and traffic analysis tasks. Wrote scripts to process large amount ofArUco codes. Collected, cleaned and augmented dataset for training
