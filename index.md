# ZHANG Shuyuan
A dedicated Computer Science graduate from the University of Edinburgh, currently pursuing an MSc in Advanced Computing at Imperial College London. With a solid background in **Computer Vision**, **Computer Graphics**, and **Natural Language Processing**, he has gained valuable experience in various technical domains, including *digital humans* and *large language models*.

## TL;DR:
### CV/CG
- UoE Bachelor Dissertation: *Inverse Procedural Modeling: from Sketches to Buildings*
    - Blender add-on, DAG, [*Distortion Renderer*](https://github.com/SanBingYouYong/distortion-renderer), Encoder-decoder, Multi-task decoders
- took all (both) CG courses available at UoE: 
    - C++ Ray Tracer, Mesh Reconstruction from point clouds, Discrete Analysis and Parameterization

### NLP
- UoE NLP Coursess: *Foundations of Natural Language Processing* & *Natural Language Understanding, Generation and Machine Translation*
    - from *N-gram, Bayesian probabilities* to *RNN, GRU, LSTM* and finally *Transformer and Attention* mechanism
- NLP for games: built Stellaris namelist mod based on Ngram probabilities computed in a Chinese poetry dataset (500+ subs!)

### LLMs
- no money so focused on applications: 
    - Prompt Engineering, Multi-agent systems, OpenAI API, Ollama API
    - Generate fine-tune data for low-resource tasks

### Digital Humans
- Deployed open-source frameworks and made contributions: 
    - [Linly_Talker](https://github.com/Kedreamix/Linly-Talker)
    - [GPT-SoVITS](https://github.com/RVC-Boss/GPT-SoVITS)
    - [metahuman-stream](https://github.com/lipku/metahuman-stream)
    - [QAnything](https://github.com/netease-youdao/QAnything)

### Internet of Things
- UoE Course: *Principles and Design of IoT Systems*
    - wearable devices, human activity recognition, deploy trained models to android

### System Engineering
- Group Project: A domino-placing robot based on TurtleBot, Lego motors, 3D printed parts and an Android App for Bluetooth connection to the robot for the course *System Design Project*
