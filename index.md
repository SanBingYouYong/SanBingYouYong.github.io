Shuyuan is a dedicated Computer Science graduate from the University of Edinburgh, currently pursuing an MSc in Advanced Computing at Imperial College London. With a solid background in **Computer Vision**, **Computer Graphics**, and **Natural Language Processing**, Shuyuan has gained valuable experience in various technical domains, including *digital humans* and *large language models*.

## Highlights
### Computer Vision / Computer Graphics
- UoE Course: *Computer Graphics: Rendering* & *Computer Graphics: Geometry and Simulation*
    - Learn C++ from scratch and implement **Ray Tracing** with advanced features including texture, acceleration hierarchy based on BVH, path tracing, pixel sampling, lens/aperture sampling and light sampling
    - **Mesh Reconstruction** from point clouds, discrete analysis and parameterization
- UoE Bachelor Dissertation: *Inverse Procedural Modeling: from Sketches to Buildings*
    - Construct a procedural model for buildings based on Directed Acyclic Graphs (DAG)
    - Distort 3D models and render as a 2D sketch image; generate training data with parameter sampling
    - Encoder-decoder & Multi-task decoders that predict DAG parameters based on input sketch image
    - Develop Blender add-on as user interface

### Natural Language Processing
- UoE Coursess: *Foundations of Natural Language Processing* & *Natural Language Understanding, Generation and Machine Translation*
    - N-gram, Bayesian probabilities, RNN, GRU, LSTM, Transformer and Attention mechanism
    - Group Project for the course *Machine Learning Practical*: Query-focused Summarization via GPT Prompting on Ambiguous QA
- Extracurricular Application: 
    - N-gram probabilities from Chinese poetry and as a name-generator mod for the game Stellaris, with over 500 subscriptions. 

### Large Language Models
- Application: 
    - Prompt Engineering, Multi-agent systems, OpenAI API, Ollama API
    - Task breakdown for better performance and robustness via designing and implementing Multi-agent systems
    - Generate fine-tune data for low-resource tasks
    - Deployed on remote server [QAnything](https://github.com/netease-youdao/QAnything) to serve as a LLM backend with knowledge base

### Digital Humans
- Deployed on remote server, extended and contributed to the open-source metahuman framework [Linly_Talker](https://github.com/Kedreamix/Linly-Talker), working with QAnything as an extra method to generate speech text for digital humans
- Deployed on remote server [GPT-SoVITS](https://github.com/RVC-Boss/GPT-SoVITS) to fine-tune models for voice cloning
- Deployed on remote server [metahuman-stream](https://github.com/lipku/metahuman-stream) as a real-time digital human streaming method

### Internet of Things
- UoE Course: *Principles and Design of IoT Systems*
    - Collect human activity data through wearable devices
    - Design, implement and train neural networks (CNN, RNN, LSTM with model ensembling) to identify activity and respiratory symptoms
    - Develop Android App to deploy trained models, connect to sensors via Bluetooth and classify human activities /respiratory symptoms in real-time

### System Engineering
- Group Project: A domino-placing robot based on TurtleBot, Lego motors, 3D printed parts and an Android App for Bluetooth connection to the robot for the course *System Design Project*
    - Designed the domino-reloading and automatic placement mechanism
    - Designed and modelled the 3D printed parts
    - Wrote Python scripts to control the Lego motors
    - Coordinated Android App development
    - Designed and implemented the communication method between server, robot and the app
